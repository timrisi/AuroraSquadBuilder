        <Ability>The first time you are hit by an attack each round, assign the &quot;I'll Show You the Dark Side&quot; Condition card to the attacker.

I'll Show You The Dark Side:  When this card is assigned, if it is not already in play, the player who assigned it searches the Damage deck for 1 Damage card with the Pilot trait and may place it faceup on this card.  Then shuffle the damage deck.

When you suffer critical damage during an attack, you are instead dealt the chosen faceup Damage card.

When there is no Damage card on this card, remove it.</Ability>

        <Ability>The first time you are hit by an attack each round, assign the &quot;I'll Show You the Dark Side&quot; Condition card to the attacker.

I'll Show You The Dark Side:  When this card is assigned, if it is not already in play, the player who assigned it searches the Damage deck for 1 Damage card with the Pilot trait and may place it faceup on this card.  Then shuffle the damage deck.

When you suffer critical damage during an attack, you are instead dealt the chosen faceup Damage card.

When there is no Damage card on this card, remove it.</Ability>
